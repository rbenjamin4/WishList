            <p>The Buy Me Things smart wish list system is a web application that helps users create lists for gift exchanges. Each user account can create multiple lists for different events (birthdays, holidays, etc.) that can be shared with other people. These other users (who also need to create accounts) can buy items off the list that's shared with them and mark individual items as bought. Lists include an event date, which will act as the expiration date for being able to buy items. Only after the event date can the list owner see what has been purchased off of their wish list.</p>
